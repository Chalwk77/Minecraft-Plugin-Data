# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Here you can create your own rules for chat that will apply# for following aspects of the game: commands, chat, signs, books and items## [NOTICE] Files by default contain examples that you can safely remove or change.# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------## Operators:# match <regex> (A valid regular expression string to match the message.)# id <number/string> (Assign an id/name to the rule. Used in messages and handlers. Not mandatory.)# require perm <permission> [message] (Only execute the rule if the player has specified permission.#                                      An optional parameter [message] is the no permission message.)# ignore string <string/regex> (If the message matches given string it will be ignored.)# ignore event <chat/commands/signs> (If the rule triggers on specified event it will be ignored.)# ignore perm <permission> (A permission to bypass the rule.)# ignore gamemode <survival/creative/adventure/spectator/0/1/2/3> (Gamemodes to be ignored. Separate by | to add multiple gamemodes.)# ignore usernames (Rule will ignore the names of the players online. Can degrade performance when having over 100 players.)# ignore chatdisplay <setName> (If chat ignorer is enabled and a rule catches the message, players who ignore the set won't see the message.)# before strip <regex> (A valid regular expression used to strip specified characters before the message is checked.)# before replace <regex> with <message> (A regular expression used to replace characters with other characters before the message is checked.)# then replace <replacement|replacement2> (A string that replaces only the part of the checked message that matches the match.)#                                         (Chosen randomly from the messages divided by |)# then rewrite <message|message2> (A message that replaces the entire checked message.)#                                         (Chosen randomly from the messages divided by |)# then deny (Cancel the player's message from appearing in the chat.)# then console <command|command2|command3> (A commands to execute as the console. Use %player to get player name. Divide multiple commands by |)# then warn <message> (A message that is displayed to the player. TIP: Use | to split message on multiple lines (when \n is not working for you))# then kick <optionalReason> (If set, the player will be kicked with optional message.)# then notify <permission> <message> (Send a message to all players with specified permission.)# then fine <amount> (If plugin Vault is installed - take specified amount of money from the player.)# then points <set> <amount> (If points system is enabled (in settings.yml), give the player specified amount of points.)#                            (NOTICE: If you have global warning set, you do not need to specify the <set> if you want to give points to it)# then log (Caught message will be printed in console and saved in rules_log.txt)# handle as <handler_name> (Launch actions specified in handlers.yml)## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------# [TIP] The plugin supports regex capturing groups and it is possible to#       refer to them in other operators with $<number>.# Example: match You are being teleported to (.*)#          then rewrite You have been moved to $1.
