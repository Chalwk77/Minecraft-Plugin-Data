############## Invisibility Method ###############
##################################################
InvisibilityMethod:
  # The method of hiding players; Available methods: Bukkit, ProtocolLib, Combined

  # 'Bukkit': Uses Bukkit's API to hide players, this is an extremely reliable method if other plugins don't break it.
  # This method ALWAYS hides invisible players in the tablist for players that can't see them.
  # The chance that another plugin breaks this method is medium depending on the amount and type of plugins.
  # > Recommended if you don't want to/can not use ProtocolLib; other plugins can break this method though
  # (Accuracy: 95%) (Plugin compatibility: 90%)

  # 'ProtocolLib': Uses ProtocolLib to hide players. Takes the whole packet stuff into its own hands to cancel every
  # single packet of hidden players.
  # This method CAN show invisible players in the tablist for players who can't see them if that's enabled.
  # Hard to break, however, other plugins might not provide direct support for this hider.
  # > Obviously requires ProtocolLib; Recommended if you want to show invisible players in the tablist
  # (Accuracy: 90%) (Plugin compatibility: 95%)

  # 'Combined: Uses both ProtocolLib and Bukkit's API to hide players, this method does NOT support showing players
  # in the tablist but it contains two layers of security and is therefore an extremely effective method.
  # The chance that another plugin breaks this method is extremly small.
  # > Requires ProtocolLib; Default hider; Recommended if you don't want to show invisible players in the tablist
  # (Accuracy: 100%) (Plugin compatibility: 98%) - DEFAULT

  PlayerHider: "Combined"

  # Note: Even 'Combined' can't stop players from figuring out whether invisible players are online if another
  # plugin tells them but players will never be able to see them at all or figure out their location
  # (Essentials is 99% compatible)

  # Should the Combined and ProtocolLib hiders intercept Scoreboard Team packets too? It prevents
  # non-existing but theoretically possible hacked clients from figuring out whether an invisible
  # player is online however it can also cause problems with tablist player prefixes and suffixes
  # by other plugins.
  StrictInvisibility: false

  # Should the Combined and Bukkit hiders force players into being invisible every tick (Bukkit) or every
  # second (Combined)? This may cause lag if there are lots of players on the server.
